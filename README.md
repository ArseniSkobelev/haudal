<!-- About section -->
## About the project
This project was started with a real problem in mind; __Authentication implementation in web development.__ It has always been a struggle to spend several work hours creating a full fledged OAuth-a-like system for your REST API for each new project.

<br />

So, the initial goal of Haudal was to create a system that could be reused and/or modified per ones project needs. As the time went, the project grew bigger, and now it is not only an authentication service, but rather a community project that will *(in theory)* have several easy-to-integrate services ready for use.

<br />
<br />

### Built with
This list of technologies used is not meant to be organized in any way shape or form. Therefore, please refer to a sub directory of __codebase/__ to find out what a given service in based upon.

### Motivaiton
The main motivation of this project was to learn and practice the whole development process as a fullstack developer. I also wanted to add DevOps skills to my CV; Therefore I've landed on a tech stack that includes on-prem deployment and other relevant DevOps skills. My goal was to:
* Learn __Kubernetes__ and host an on-prem cluster running strictly [my own](https://github.com/arseniskobelev) software 
* Expand my previous knowledge on __Docker__
* Create a project that would *(in theory)* land me a job as a software developer after my apprenticeship

<br />

## Services
This section of the README will present to you a map of all the services and a short explanation of their sole purpose. Please bear in mind that this map is created at a stage where not all of the services are yet implemented.
